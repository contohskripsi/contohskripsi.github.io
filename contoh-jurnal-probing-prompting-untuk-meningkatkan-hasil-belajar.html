                                            Read the following passage and choose the best answer.Most people can remember a phone number for up to thirty seconds. When this short amount of time elapses, however, the numbers are erased from the memory. How did the information get there in the first place? Information that makes its way to the short term memory (STM) does so via the sensory storage area. The brain has a filter which only allows stimuli that is of immediate interest to pass on to the STM, also known as the working memory.There is much debate about the capacity and duration of the short term memory. The most accepted theory comes from George A. Miller, a cognitive psychologist who suggested that humans can remember approximately seven chunks of information. A chunk is defined as a meaningful unit of information, such as a word or name rather than just a letter or number. Modern theorists suggest that one can increase the capacity of the short term memory by chunking, or classifying similar information together. By organizing information, one can optimize the STM, and improve the chances of a memory being passed on to long term storage.When making a conscious effort to memorize something, such as information for an exam, many people engage in "rote rehearsal". By repeating something over and over again, one is able to keep a memory alive. Unfortunately, this type of memory maintenance only succeeds if there are no interruptions. As soon as a person stops rehearsing the information, it has the tendency to disappear. When a pen and paper are not handy, people often attempt to remember a phone number by repeating it aloud. If the doorbell rings or the dog barks to come in before a person has the opportunity to make a phone call, he will likely forget the number instantly.* Therefore, rote rehearsal is not an efficient way to pass information from the short term to long term memory.* A better way is to practice "elaborate rehearsal". *This involves assigning semantic meaning to a piece of information so that it can be filed along with other pre-existing long term memories.*Encoding information semantically also makes it more retrievable. Retrieving information can be done by recognition or recall. Humans can easily recall memories that are stored in the long term memory and used often; however, if a memory seems to be forgotten, it may eventually be retrieved by prompting. The more cues a person is given (such as pictures), the more likely a memory can be retrieved. This is why multiple choice tests are often used for subjects that require a lot of memorization.1.

He is the first Indonesian to win any medal in at the under-20 IAAF championships by taking home a Gold medal in the 100m.Zohri was born and raised in a small village of the North Lombok Regency, on the eastern island of Lombok, in a house made of wood and woven bamboo. He is the youngest of four children. His parents died when he was young. He couldn’t even afford shoes, prompting him to train barefoot. He convinced his sister to lend him Rp 400,000 (21 Euros) so he could buy a pair of spikes for his meets. He won the 100m at the 2018 Asian Junior Athletics Championships in Japan in a time of 10.27 seconds.Zohri competed for Indonesia at the 2018 IAAF World U20 Championships in the 100m. In the first round, he placed first with a time of 10.30 seconds. In the semifinal, he placed second with a slightly better time at 10.24, behind World Youth 100m Record Holder and Gold Medal favorite Anthony Schwartz. He was drawn to lane eight in the final, which started less than three hours later. When the pistol fired, Zohri got a decent start, staying right behind Schwartz who led. He closed-in slowly at 60 meters, and in the last ten meters, he surged ahead of Schwartz to take the Gold Medal by a dip. His time of 10.18 seconds (+1.2m/s) became an Indonesian Junior Record, just slightly different from Indonesian National Record at the time of 10.17 by Suryo Agung Wibowo at the 2009 Southeast Asian Games.Zohri was labeled as a national hero for his deeds; Indonesian President Joko Widodo ordered two cabinet ministers to arrange for his house to be renovated.

A powerful earthquake rattled Yogyakarta, Java, Indonesia, in the early morning hours of May 27, 2006. The quake destroyed more than 60,000 houses in the city, and killed an estimated 6,234 people, reported the World Health Organization on June 6. Though Indonesia experiences frequent earthquakes, the May 27 quake was unusual in that it was centered about 10 kilometers under the Earth’s surface, according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS). Most earthquakes in Indonesia occur deep under the Earth’s surface where the slab of the Earth’s crust that carries Australia (the Australia Plate) sinks beneath the Sunda Plate on which the islands of Indonesia ride. Earthquakes occur in the sometimes-messy grind of colliding plates, but these are centered deep below the Earth’s surface. The May 27 earthquake happened near the surface along a fault in the Sunda Plate, about 20 kilometers south-southeast of Yogyakarta.
This image shows the topography of the landscape near the earthquake epicenter. Yogyakarta sits in a broad valley between two groups of roughly north-running mountains. The towering Merapi Volcano caps the northeast end of the valley. Behind it is the single peak of the Sundoro Volcano and a cluster of small peaks in the Dieng Volcano Complex. The Slamet and Cereme Volcanoes are west of Merapi in the upper-left corner of the image. The earthquake occurred along a fault east of the mountains that frame Yogyakarta to the east. The image was created from data collected by the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission.
The earthquake is not the only geologic activity to threaten the region: the Merapi volcano was also rumbling at the end of May. The volcano sent clouds of hot gas and lava down its slopes on June 6, prompting the evacuation of 11,000 people, said news reports. The ASTER sensor on NASA’s Terra satellite captured an image of the volcano in action on  June 6. The volcano had been showing signs of increased activity since April, but activity picked up after the May 27 earthquake. While volcanic activity and earthquakes are often connected, it is not clear if the May 27 earthquake is directly linked to Merapi’s activity, said the USGS. The same underlying geologic processes may have triggered both events.</a>

The volcano last erupted in 1963, Killing over 1,000 people.president Joko Widodo has ordered the military and all emergency services to assist with evecuees and stranded tourists.Volcanologists first detected seismic activity at Mount Agung since August. the activity peaked in mid-September, prompting Indonesia's national saster agency to raise its highest alert level for the volcano and evacuating more than 20,000 residents.the vast archipelago of Indonesia is located along the Pacific's so-called "Ring of Fire", a seismically active line of faults where earthquakes and volcanoes are common.#tolongdibantuyakak#pliss​</a>

                            4. Read the following passage and choose the best answer.Most people can remember a phone number for up to thirty seconds. When this short amount of time elapses, however, the numbers are erased from the memory. How did the information get there in the first place? Information that makes its way to the short term memory (STM) does so via the sensory storage area. The brain has a filter which only allows stimuli that is of immediate interest to pass on to the STM, also known as the working memory.There is much debate about the capacity and duration of the short term memory. The most accepted theory comes from George A. Miller, a cognitive psychologist who suggested that humans can remember approximately seven chunks of information. A chunk is defined as a meaningful unit of information, such as a word or name rather than just a letter or number. Modern theorists suggest that one can increase the capacity of the short term memory by chunking, or classifying similar information together. By organizing information, one can optimize the STM, and improve the chances of a memory being passed on to long term storage.When making a conscious effort to memorize something, such as information for an exam, many people engage in "rote rehearsal". By repeating something over and over again, one is able to keep a memory alive. Unfortunately, this type of memory maintenance only succeeds if there are no interruptions. As soon as a person stops rehearsing the information, it has the tendency to disappear. When a pen and paper are not handy, people often attempt to remember a phone number by repeating it aloud. If the doorbell rings or the dog barks to come in before a person has the opportunity to make a phone call, he will likely forget the number instantly.* Therefore, rote rehearsal is not an efficient way to pass information from the short term to long term memory.* A better way is to practice "elaborate rehearsal". *This involves assigning semantic meaning to a piece of information so that it can be filed along with other pre-existing long term memories.*Encoding information semantically also makes it more retrievable. Retrieving information can be done by recognition or recall. Humans can easily recall memories that are stored in the long term memory and used often; however, if a memory seems to be forgotten, it may eventually be retrieved by prompting. The more cues a person is given (such as pictures), the more likely a memory can be retrieved. This is why multiple choice tests are often used for subjects that require a lot of memorization.1.

He is the youngest of four children. His parents died when he was young. He couldn’t even afford shoes, prompting him to train barefoot. He convinced his sister to lend him Rp 400,000 (21 Euros) so he could buy a pair of spikes for his meets.

He was drawn to lane eight in the final, which started less than three hours later. When the pistol fired, Zohri got a decent start, staying right behind Schwartz who led. He closed-in slowly at 60 meters, and in the last ten meters, he surged ahead of Schwartz to take the Gold Medal by a dip. His time of 10.18 seconds (+1.2m/s) became an Indonesian Junior Record, just slightly different from Indonesian National Record at the time of 10.17 by Suryo Agung Wibowo at the 2009 Southeast Asian Games.Zohri was labeled as a national hero for his deeds; Indonesian President Joko Widodo ordered two cabinet ministers to arrange for his house to be renovated.

A powerful earthquake rattled Yogyakarta, Java, Indonesia, in the early morning hours of May 27, 2006. The quake destroyed more than 60,000 houses in the city, and killed an estimated 6,234 people, reported the World Health Organization on June 6. Though Indonesia experiences frequent earthquakes, the May 27 quake was unusual in that it was centered about 10 kilometers under the Earth’s surface, according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS). Most earthquakes in Indonesia occur deep under the Earth’s surface where the slab of the Earth’s crust that carries Australia (the Australia Plate) sinks beneath the Sunda Plate on which the islands of Indonesia ride. Earthquakes occur in the sometimes-messy grind of colliding plates, but these are centered deep below the Earth’s surface. The May 27 earthquake happened near the surface along a fault in the Sunda Plate, about 20 kilometers south-southeast of Yogyakarta.
This image shows the topography of the landscape near the earthquake epicenter. Yogyakarta sits in a broad valley between two groups of roughly north-running mountains. The towering Merapi Volcano caps the northeast end of the valley. Behind it is the single peak of the Sundoro Volcano and a cluster of small peaks in the Dieng Volcano Complex. The Slamet and Cereme Volcanoes are west of Merapi in the upper-left corner of the image. The earthquake occurred along a fault east of the mountains that frame Yogyakarta to the east. The image was created from data collected by the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission.
The earthquake is not the only geologic activity to threaten the region: the Merapi volcano was also rumbling at the end of May. The volcano sent clouds of hot gas and lava down its slopes on June 6, prompting the evacuation of 11,000 people, said news reports. The ASTER sensor on NASA’s Terra satellite captured an image of the volcano in action on  June 6. The volcano had been showing signs of increased activity since April, but activity picked up after the May 27 earthquake. While volcanic activity and earthquakes are often connected, it is not clear if the May 27 earthquake is directly linked to Merapi’s activity, said the USGS. The same underlying geologic processes may have triggered both events.</h2><br />
